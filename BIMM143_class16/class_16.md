### Volcano Plot

``` r
plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj) )
```

![](class_16_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)

Q. Improve this plot by completing the below code, which adds color and axis labels

``` r
# Make a color vector for all genes
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res) )

# Color red the genes with absolute fold change above 2
mycols[ abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 ] <- "red"

# Color blue those with adjusted p-value less than 0.01
#  and absolute fold change more than 2
inds <- (res$padj < 0.01) & (abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 )
mycols[ inds ] <- "blue"

plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj), col= mycols, xlab="Log2(FoldChange)", ylab="-Log(P-value)" )
```

Q. Finally for this section let’s reorder these results by adjusted p-value and save them to a CSV file in your current project directory.

``` r
res = res[order(res$pvalue),]
write.csv(res, file ="deseq_results.csv")
```

Pathway Analysis
----------------

### KEGG pathways

First we need to do our one time install of these required bioconductor packages:

``` r
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite( c("pathview", "gage", "gageData") )
```

Now we can load the packages and setup the KEGG data-sets we need.

``` r
library(pathview)
```

The main gage() function requires a named vector of fold changes, where the names of the values are the Entrez gene IDs.

Note that we used the mapIDs() function above to obtain Entrez gene IDs (stored in res*e**n**t**r**e**z*)*a**n**d**w**e**h**a**v**e**t**h**e**f**o**l**d**c**h**a**n**g**e**r**e**s**u**l**t**s**f**r**o**m**D**E**S**e**q*2*a**n**a**l**y**s**i**s*(*s**t**o**r**e**d**i**n**r**e**s*log2FoldChange).

``` r
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez

Now, let’s try out the pathview() function from the pathview package to make a pathway plot with our RNA-Seq expression results shown in color. To begin with lets manually supply a pathway.id (namely the first part of the "hsa04110 Cell cycle") that we could see from the print out above.

``` r
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110")
```

    ## 'select()' returned 1:1 mapping between keys and columns

    ## Info: Working in directory /Users/cjy/Desktop/WI19/BIMM143/bimm143_github/BIMM143_class16

    ## Info: Writing image file hsa04110.pathview.png

![](hsa04110.pathview.png)

``` r
# A different PDF based output of the same data
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110", kegg.native=FALSE)
```

    ## 'select()' returned 1:1 mapping between keys and columns

    ## Info: Working in directory /Users/cjy/Desktop/WI19/BIMM143/bimm143_github/BIMM143_class16

    ## Info: Writing image file hsa04110.pathview.pdf

Now, let’s process our results a bit more to automagicaly pull out the top 5 upregulated pathways, then further process that just to get the pathway IDs needed by the pathview() function. We’ll use these KEGG pathway IDs for pathview plotting below.

``` r
## Focus on top 5 upregulated pathways here for demo purposes only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
```

    ## [1] "hsa04640" "hsa04630" "hsa00140" "hsa04142" "hsa04330"

Finally, lets pass these IDs in keggresids to the pathview() function to draw plots for all the top 5 pathways.

``` r
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresids, species="hsa")
```

Q. Can you do the same procedure as above to plot the pathview figures for the top 5 down-reguled pathways?

``` r
# Focus on top 5 downregualted pathways here 
keggres_down_reg_pathways <- rownames(keggres$less)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of wach string
keggres_down_reg_pathways_ids = substr(keggres_down_reg_pathways, start = 1, stop = 8)
keggres_down_reg_pathways_ids
```

    ## [1] "hsa04110" "hsa03030" "hsa03013" "hsa03440" "hsa04114"

``` r
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggres_down_reg_pathways_ids, species="hsa")
```
